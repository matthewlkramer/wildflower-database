Wildflower is a network of tiny, teacher-led Montessori schools. Schools are generally 1 or 2 classrooms and are led by 1-3 educators (called teacher leaders or TLs) serving 20-50 children. Classrooms generally serve 0-3 year olds, 3-6 year olds, 6-12 year olds (sometimes broken up 6-9 and 9-12), 7th-8th graders, and high school age children. A two classroom school can serve two adjacent age bands. Schools can be organized as any of several governance/funding models: non-profit preschools, non-profit K-12 schools, or charter K-12 schools. For the first types of schools, they charge tuition to families who can pay and lower income families are subsidized through public childcare subsidies, universal pre-K programs, Educational Savings Accounts, tax credit scholarship programs, or other similar programs.Charter schools are free to all children and families.

Educators typically come to Wildflower with a dream for the type of school they hope to open and they go through a process called the School Startup Journey on the path to opening.  

This app is to support people who work with these teacher leaders - operations guides, cohort leaders, regional entrepreneurs - to know what the schools and TLs they work with are up to.
